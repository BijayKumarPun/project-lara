# Welcome to Project Lara


Project Lara is a playground project that was destined to go into development hell-hole since Day 1.
Don't be surprised if you do not find anything interesting here, because there isn't any. Might as well stop searching for such.
 
This is a pure Laravel Project, thus the name, and has been written using Vim editor as the main IDE. When this project was started, the developer had 0 idea about Laravel, and 0.1 idea about Vim. To make it worse, the developer has written less than 10 lines of code in PHP. And the final blow is the selection of Vim as primary IDE.

If you see that this project has less than 100 commits and the last commit was 30 days ago, then assume the developer could not keep up with the deveopment environment.

## More updates about the development process below:

- Development work has been moved to **dev** branch; #a1ab9e4
