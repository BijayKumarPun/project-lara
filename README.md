# Welcome to Project Lara 

```
php artisan serve
```

Project Lara is a playground project that was destined to go into development hell-hole since Day 1.
If you came here in hope of finding something useful, then prepare to be utterly disappointed.
 
This is a pure Laravel Project, thus the name, and has been written using Vim editor as the main and only IDE. This project was started by someone with no prior knowledge of PHP, let alone Laravel. Also, a lot of the early struggles were in navigating through Vim.

If you see that this project has less than 100 commits and the last commit was more than 30 days ago, then assume the project has been permanently abandoned as developer could not keep up with the development setup.

## More updates about the development process below:

- Development work has been moved to **dev** branch; #a1ab9e4
- Many concepts have been driven from Laravel: Up and Running by Matt Stauffer, a really nice book on Laravel for beginners
- Update : 21st May, This statement was added for commit purpose only; See the 30 days - 100 commit rule above
